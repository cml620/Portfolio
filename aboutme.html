<h2>My Background and Where Feel Grounded</h2>
<p>I'm Cindy Myacint Liu and I'm currently 17 years old. I was born in Yangoon, Burma, but I moved to the Bay Area when I was one and a half years old. I am Burmese and Chinese as my parents are both a mix of the two ethnicities as well. Since I have been living in America for almost my entire life, I do consider myself American. My full name represents my three identities as my first name is American, my second name is Burmese, and my last name is Chinese. One of my favorite hobbies include
volunteering and participating within a club at my high school called Interact where we lend a helping hand to both our communities and countries across oceans from us. I also tremendously love music as I have been apart of my high school's choir for all four years. </p>
