<h1>My Background and Where I Feel Grounded</h1>
<p>I'm Cindy Myacint Liu and I'm currently 17 years old. I was born in Yangoon, Burma, but I moved to the Bay Area when I was one and half years old. My parents are both Burmese and Chinese which makes me a mixed Burmese and Chinese individual as well. My hobbies include volunteering and participating within a club at my high school called Interact where we lend a helping hand to both our communities and countries across oceans from us. I also termendously love music as I have been apart of my high school's choir for all four years. </p>
