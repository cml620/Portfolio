<h1>My Background and Where I Feel Grounded</h1>
<p>I'm Cindy Myacint Liu and I'm currently 17 years old. I was born in Yangoon, Burma, but I moved to the Bay Area when I was one and half years old. My parents are both Burmese and Chinese which makes me a mixed Burmese and Chinese invdividual as well.</p>
